# Recipe Book App

### Description

Recipe Book App is a web application that allows users to share and browse their own recipes. Users can add new recipes, filter existing ones, view recipe details, and leave comments.

## Main feature (Challenge)

1. **View Recipes** : Users can view all available recipes in the app.

2. **Add Recipes**: Users can add their own recipes using a simple form.

3. **Filter Recipes**: Users can filter recipes based on cuisine, difficulty and dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free).

4. **View Recipe Details**: Users can view the details of a single recipe and leave comments.

## Technologies

- **React**: Used for building the user interface.

- **TypeScript**: Used to provide more stability to the code by adding types to classic JavaScript.

- **Axios**: Used for making HTTP requests.

- **CSS**: Used instead of Tailwind because, when used with proper class naming conventions, it can make the code cleaner.

- **FontAwesome**: Used for Icons.

- **Vite**: Used as the bundler.

- **ESLint**: Used for maintaining consistent code style.
